## About me ##
I'm a project manager. One day it came to me that I was using smart devices without completely understanding how they work. I thought it was important to understand this, and as a result I found RS_School. Having become acquainted with the teaching methodology, I realized that mastering programming is possible and everything depends on my perseverance, patience and hard work. In addition, I'll can learn new skills without interrupting work, using free time. This suits me very well and I hope everything works out for me!
